# Zlepper's RimWorld mods and ModSdks

This repository contains all the mods I have made for RimWorld, and the ModSdk I use for developing them.

The ModSdk is DotNet SDK for setting up a working RimWorld modding environment without most of the normal hassle.
Check the [readme](Zlepper.RimWorld.ModSdk/readme.md) for more information. There is also an SDK for making unit
tests available for your mod, which is documented [here](Zlepper.RimWorld.ModSdk.Testing/readme.md).
